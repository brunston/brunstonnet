                <h2>stellarPYL</h2>
                <p> An open-source download for stellarPYL is available at <a href="https://github.com/brunston/stellarpyl">brunston/stellarpyl on GitHub</a></p>
                <p>stellarPYL is open-source stellar spectra reduction and analysis command-line software written in Python 3. stellarPYL aims to provide a simplified workflow for analyzing uncompressed TIFF stellar spectra images obtained from a DSLR through a diffraction grating. It allows people with limited resources to gather and analyze their own astronomical data.</p>
                <p>It is a part of the larger stellarPYL integrative stellar spectroscopy system which I designed, which includes hardware specifications for data collection as well as in-lab calibration methods. This project reduces the cost required to perform quantitative stellar spectroscopy fivefold (from ~$1500 to $300) and uses existing COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) technology. stellarPYL can do the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>automatically crop the image based on intensity parameters</li>
                    <li>perform automated background subtraction</li>
                    <li>generate an intensity plot of the spectrum while accounting for non-pixel-orthogonal spectra and diffraction grating resolution</li>
                    <li>account for the use of a DSLR sensor by using two images taken the same night of different stars to create a relative response function for the individual sensor and observation time.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This project was supported by Dr. Geoff Mathews of the University of Hawaii, the Thomas Penrose Bennett Prize grants, and the St. Paul's School Engineering Honors program.</p>
